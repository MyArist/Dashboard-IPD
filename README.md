# Data Visualization of IPD [ðŸŒŽ](https://myarist.github.io/Data-Visualization-of-IPD/)

This is a data visualization project from BPS data, more precisely IPD data in 2014. You can ge the data from [the following link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj33PD2zeroAhWRX3wKHazvA3cQFjAAegQIAhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bappenas.go.id%2Ffiles%2F5514%2F4704%2F6044%2FBuku_Indeks_Pembangunan_Desa_2014.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2DgmTAtrV1D0Xr_MR_2yJA).

The visualization that I made, using several programming languages, the main ones are javascript (d3.js).

For more publication about d3.js, you can see it on its [official page](http://d3js.org/).

This data consists of many lines, exactly 74090, which are quite complicated.

So that visualization is needed that makes it easy to read and find information in data.

There are several visualizations that I use, including maps, parallel plots, and star plots.
